Handling Short Texts: It's essential to note that langdetect may not be as accurate with very short texts, as statistical patterns might not be sufficient for reliable language detection. For better results, it is advisable to use longer texts.

Error Handling: In some cases, the library may raise a lang_detect_exception.LangDetectException if it encounters any issues during language detection. It is good practice to handle such exceptions to ensure smooth functioning of your application.

langdetect is a handy tool for various natural language processing tasks, such as multilingual support in applications, language-aware content filtering, sentiment analysis across multiple languages, and more. However, as with any language detection library, it may have limitations with certain types of texts, mixed languages, or code-switching scenarios. Therefore, it's essential to assess the accuracy and suitability of langdetect for your specific use case.
